Follow these steps to get a local copy of Mango up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm or Yarn

Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Natasha-cyber777/mango.git
cd mango

(Note: Replace https://github.com/Natasha-cyber777/mango.git with the actual URL of your Mango repository if it's different).

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or if you prefer yarn:
yarn install

Firebase Configuration (Environment Variables):
Mango connects to Firebase, and your sensitive configuration details should not be committed to Git.

Create a .env file in the root of your project directory.

Populate it with your Firebase project's configuration. You can find these values in your Firebase project settings (Project overview -> Project settings -> General -> Your apps -> Web app section). Remember to prefix variables with REACT_APP_ for Create React App projects:

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID

Crucially, ensure .env is listed in your .gitignore file.

Run the application:

npm start
# or:
yarn start

This will start the development server, and Mango should open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.
